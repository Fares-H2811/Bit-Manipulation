# Bit-Manipulation
Description:
This project marks the beginning of an exciting journey into C/C++ programming as part of the learning phase for our team, Z Fast Racing. It demonstrates fundamental bit-level operations and menu-driven programming. The goal of this task was to strengthen our understanding of low-level programming concepts, such as bit manipulation, and how they can be applied in real-world scenarios.

As a team, we aim to explore and master programming techniques that will power innovative solutions for Z Fast Racing. This repository is the first step toward building a solid foundation in programming and problem-solving, paving the way for more complex and impactful projects in the future.

Key Features:

Implements basic bit manipulation functions (set, clear, toggle, read).
Checks if a number is positive/negative or even/odd.
Fully interactive menu-driven console application.
Written as part of a collaborative learning experience.
Our Mission:
Through teamwork, creativity, and dedication, Z Fast Racing aims to combine technology and innovation in our racing projects. This repository symbolizes our commitment to learning and growing as a team in both engineering and software development.
